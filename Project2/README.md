```
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Cells live or die based on basic rules, which are the following:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all - - other dead cells stay dead.
```
Make the grids / board using HTML and CSS and simulate the cellular automaton using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
